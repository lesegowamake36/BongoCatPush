Application: BongoCat Autoplay — Autoclicker for Bongo Cat

🎵 Brief Tagline: Become a bongo cat virtuoso! Automatic piano and drum play.

🐾 Main Concept:
BongoCat Autoplay is a specialized tool that turns you into the perfect musician for the virtual cat. The application automatically presses the necessary keys in the Bongo Cat game, allowing you to reproduce complex piano melodies and intricate drum rhythms without a single mistake and with perfect timing.

🎹 Key Features:

1. Specialization for Bongo Cat:

📂 Ready-made presets for popular songs: A database with settings for the automatic performance of famous melodies (from classics to game and anime soundtracks).

⏺️ On-screen action recording: Simply play a melody at a slow tempo — the application will accurately record the sequence and time intervals of your presses to reproduce it perfectly later.

🐱🎹 Two operating modes: Separate settings for the piano zone (keys) and the drum zone (cat). Can be used simultaneously or separately.

2. Perfect Timing and Adaptation:

📏 Calibration for your screen: Automatic detection of click areas for any resolution and game window size.

⚙️ Micro-correction of delays: Fine-tuning pauses between notes for precise matching of the original music tempo.

🎚️ Speed adjustment: Playback of the recorded melody faster or slower.

3. Convenience and Control:

🛠️ Transparent control widget: A small panel over the game for instant start, pause, or preset switching.

⌨️ Hotkeys: Control the autoclicker without being distracted from the game (e.g., F5 – start, F6 – stop).

📝 Sequence editor: View, edit, and save your created press patterns as a clear list.

📽️ Main Usage Scenarios:

🎬 Creating perfect musical videos: Recording impressive and flawless videos performing complex compositions for YouTube, TikTok, or Twitch.

🎉 Entertainment and experiments: Instantly "soundtrack" streams or video calls with professionally sounding melodies.

🧠 Learning melodies: Use slow playback to visually and audibly understand the structure and fingering of a complex track.

✋ Finger rest: Let your hands rest while the application entertains you or your viewers with music.

⚙️ Technical Details and Safety:

🔧 System-level operation: Uses accessibility services or input emulation functions for reliable operation.

🚫 Without game modification: Does not interfere with Bongo Cat files. Works by emulating real touches/mouse clicks at specific coordinates.

🛡️ Requires permissions: To work, it is necessary to grant permission for "Display over other apps" and (depending on the OS) access to accessibility services.

⚠️ Important Notice:
This application is intended for creative use and personal entertainment. Using it to pass off results as your own in a competitive environment may go against the spirit of the game. Enjoy the music and create unique content!
